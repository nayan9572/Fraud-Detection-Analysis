Fraud Detection Analysis: A Deep Dive into Model EvaluationThis repository contains the code, data, and presentation for an end-to-end machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent bank transactions. The project goes beyond simple model building to diagnose common challenges like class imbalance and provides a final, strategic recommendation based on a rigorous analytical process.The Business ProblemBanks and financial institutions face significant financial losses from fraudulent activities. The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning system capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing the disruption to legitimate customers. The core technical challenge was a severe class imbalance, with fraudulent transactions making up less than 5% of the total dataset.Repository ContentsFraud Detection analysis assignment.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.Fraud Detection Presentation.pptx: A slide deck that summarizes the project's journey, key findings, and final recommendation.fraud_data.xlsx: The dataset used for this analysis.The Analytical Journey & Key FindingsThis project followed a deliberate, iterative process that tells a common story in real-world data science.The Accuracy Trap: Initial models achieved a misleading 95% accuracy but had a Fraud Recall of 0.00, proving they were completely ineffective.The SMOTE Breakthrough: After applying SMOTE to balance the data, a Logistic Regression model successfully achieved a Fraud Recall of 0.60.The Limits of Advanced Models: A critical insight was discovered when advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost still failed to detect fraud, even on the balanced data.A Deeper Diagnosis: Even after exhaustive hyperparameter tuning, the XGBoost model was unable to reliably detect fraud, leading to the final and most important conclusion.Final Recommendation: It's a Data Problem, Not a Model ProblemThe rigorous testing proves that the predictive "signal" from the current features is too weak. The final recommendation is therefore not a model, but a strategy:The focus must shift from model tuning to data enhancement and feature engineering.The most impactful next step is to create more powerful, context-rich features (e.g., avg_amount_vs_user_historical_avg) to provide a stronger signal for a model to learn from.How to Run This ProjectClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/nayan9572/Fraud-Detection-Analysis.git](https://github.com/nayan9572/Fraud-Detection-Analysis.git)
